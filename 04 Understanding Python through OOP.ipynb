    "# Lesson 3: Understanding Python through Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. In and of itself Python is not very powerful, but the due to its open-source nature there is a plethora of powerful libraries available that help us get things done (efficiently).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, before looking at some useful libraries, we want to get a general understanding of how Python works. In particular, I believe it is instructive to understand the object-based nature of Python.\n",

    "Learning outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand that everything in Python is an object.\n",
    "2. Understand and work with object attributes.\n",
    "3. Define your own class, methods and properties."
