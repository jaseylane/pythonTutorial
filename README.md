# pythonTutorial
Introduction to Python for Econ PhDs.

## FYI
I wrote this tutorial for some of my colleagues who are interested in using Python. In this tutorial, I want to touch upon most of the important concepts, but I do not go into depth on any single topic. The idea is that after completion of this tutorial, my colleagues can (with the help of online resources) use Python for their own work.

## What is not included?
I have not included any setup for Python and/or jupyter notebooks. There are plenty of guides floating around the interwebs for anyone who wants to run through the code of this tutorial.
